        "notes": "The use here of a dollar-change income elasticity (rather than a proportional-change elasticity) is consistent with Feldstein and Feenberg, 'The Taxation of Two Earner Families', NBER Working Paper No. 5155 (June 1995).  A proportional-change elasticity was used by Gruber and Saez, 'The elasticity of taxable income: evidence and implications', Journal of Public Economics 84:1-32 (2002) [see equation 2 on page 10].",

        "notes": "The nature of the capital-gains elasticity used here is similar to that used in Joint Committee on Taxation, 'New Evidence on the Tax Elasticity of Capital Gains: A Joint Working Paper of the Staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office', (JCX-56-12), June 2012.  In particular, the elasticity use here is equivalent to the term inside the square brackets on the right-hand side of equation (4) on page 11 --- not the epsilon variable on the left-hand side of equation (4), which is equal to the elasticity used here times the weighted average marginal tax rate on long-term capital gains.  So, the JCT-CBO estimate of -0.792 for the epsilon elasticity (see JCT-CBO, Table 5) translates into a much larger absolute value for the be_cg semi-elasticity used by Tax-Calculator. To calculate the elasticity from a semi-elasticity, we multiply by MTRs from TC and weight by shares of taxable gains. To avoid those with zero MTRs, we restrict this to the top 40% of tax units by AGI. Using this function, a semi-elasticity of -3.45 corresponds to a tax rate elasticity of -0.792.",

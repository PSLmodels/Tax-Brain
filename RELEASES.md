## 2019-03-12 Release 2.0.0

Last Merged Pull Request: [#19](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Brain/pull/19)

This is the first release of the Tax-Brain package. We are starting with version
2.0.0 because this package is effectively the second coming of the original
Tax-Brain - a web interface for the Tax-Calculator model. Accordingly, much
of the code has been copied directly from the original Tax-Brain.

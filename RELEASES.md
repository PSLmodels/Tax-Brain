# Tax-Brain Release History

## 2020-10-10 Release 2.4.0

Last Merged Pull Request [#135](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Brain/pull/135)

Changes in this release:

* Automated reports are now produced using just Pandoc ([#125](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Brain/pull/125), [#135](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Brain/pull/135))

* The Tax-Brain Compute Studio app now includes automated reports in the
downloadable content ([#76](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Brain/pull/76))

## 2019-03-12 Release 2.0.0

Last Merged Pull Request: [#19](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Brain/pull/19)

This is the first release of the Tax-Brain package. We are starting with version
2.0.0 because this package is effectively the second coming of the original
Tax-Brain - a web interface for the Tax-Calculator model. Accordingly, much
of the code has been copied directly from the original Tax-Brain.
